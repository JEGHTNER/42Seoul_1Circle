	<h1>get_next_line</h1>
  <p>get_next_line is a function that reads a file descriptor and returns the next line of text. It is commonly used in C programming to read input from files or standard input (stdin) one line at a time.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>The function is called by passing in a pointer to a string. The function will read the next line of text from the file descriptor and store it in the string pointer.</p>

<pre><code>char *get_next_line(char *line);
</code></pre>

<p>The function will return 1 if a line was read successfully, 0 if the end of the file was reached, and -1 if there was an error.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>Here is an example of how to use the get_next_line function:</p>

<pre><code>int fd;
char *line;

fd = open("file.txt", O_RDONLY);
while (get_next_line(line) != NULL)
{
	printf("%s\n", line);
	free(line);
}
close(fd);
</code></pre>

<p>This code will open the file "file.txt" for reading and print out each line of the file.</p>
